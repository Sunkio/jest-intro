Jest was originally developed by Facebook and is still maintained by Meta.

To get started, initialize an empty npm project:
```bash
npm init -y
```
Then install Jest as a dev-dependency:
``` bash
npm i jest -D
```


Unit Test:
- tests the smallest unit in isolation
- see: sum.js/sum.test.js - the function does one thing, the test tests this unit
